module.exports = function generatePrompt(name, partnerName, age, concern) {
    return `My name is ${name}, and I'm ${age} years old. I'm having an issue with my partner, ${partnerName}. The problem is: ${concern}. 

I'm looking for advice on how to address this situation. What steps can I take to improve things? Are there any communication strategies or perspectives I should consider? How can I approach this sensitively while also addressing my own needs?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I want to handle this in a way that's respectful to both of us and strengthens our relationship.`;
